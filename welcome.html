      <p>For people who require blood urgently, we have a 24×7 student run helpline with the sole aim of helping those in dire need of blood. The way this works, is that we have a database of donors who are willing to donate in such emergency situations (if there is a shortage in their area of residence/work). When we receive a request for blood, we run through this database and try to look for a donor.
         The Helpline department, in fact, is the most basic, and I am going to take the liberty of saying: the most essential part of our organization, given that is actually how BloodConnect started. It targets the need for blood at the grass-root level- where we provide blood directly to those who need it.These are broadly the three areas in which we work. We call them ‘ground level activities’, because that is exactly what they are. They target the problem right where it exists. The lack of awareness, shortage in blood banks, and urgent requirements in hospitals.
         This  way we have  established a network of youth across the country to assist in the movement.</p>

               India faces a shortage of 3 million<br>
               blood units in a year.This shortage<br>
               can be easily eliminated if only an<br>
               additional 2% of India's youth donated<br>
               blood, just once in a year.BloodConnect<br>
                has been launched with the objective of<br>
                 uniting the youth to solve this problem.
